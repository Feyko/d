# D
D is a cli tool aimed at boosting (my) productivity. The problems it solves are very specific to my use cases and so it may not be the most user-friendly or full of generic-purpose features. Nevertheless, I believe it may be of use to others once it has grown a bit. Don't hesitate to contribute ! <3
